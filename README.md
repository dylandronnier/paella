# 🥘 Paella
*A modern JAX-based pipeline for training and deploying machine learning models.*

**Paella** demonstrates how to build a modern machine learning pipeline using the [`jax-ai-stack`](https://github.com/.../jax-ai-stack).  
It serves as a practical example of how to train and deploy ML models efficiently with JAX-based tools.

In addition to the core components of the `jax-ai-stack`, Paella also integrates:

- 🤗 **[`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets)** — used as the primary source for dataset loading and management,  
- 🌊🍃 **[`marimo`](https://marimo.io)** — for interactive experimentation and exploration through notebooks,  
- 🤗 **[`safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors)** — for safe and efficient export of trained model weights.
